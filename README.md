# climenu
___
## Overview
`climenu` provides a fairly simple way to configure `simple-term-menu` to act as a command line navigable menu system.  As well as being able to be configured for launching programmes, entries an be added for scripts, start an ssh session, basically almost anything you can write a cli command for. 

## Installation
Install `simple-term-menu`

Copy the files to a folder of your choice, for me I use a `.climenu` folder in my `home` directory
```bash
mkdir $HOME/.climenu
mv climenu/* $HOME/.climenu
```
`Make `climenu.sh` executable
```bash
chmod +x .climenu/climenu.sh
```
